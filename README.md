# dotfiles

These dotfiles are for macOS. On Linux — which is currently DICE, a flavour of Scientific Linux 7 — I use stuff that is in my [Xmonad](https://github.com/qaisjp/xmonad) repo (and more).


**Files**

Use the following commands (or notes) to apply the files from this repo. Files from this repo are in the `dotfiles` folder. Commands assume you are in the home directory.

- `ln -s dotfiles/skhdrc .skhdrc`
- `ln -s dotfiles/yabairc .yabairc`

(`->` means it's a symlink)

## todo

- add zsh stuff especially my modified zsh theme
