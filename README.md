# dotfiles

These dotfiles are for macOS. On Linux — which is currently DICE, a flavour of Scientific Linux 7 — I use stuff that is in my [Xmonad](https://github.com/qaisjp/xmonad) repo (and more).

- `skhdrc` -> `.skhdrc`
- `yabairc` -> `.yabairc`

## todo

- add zsh stuff especially my modified zsh theme
